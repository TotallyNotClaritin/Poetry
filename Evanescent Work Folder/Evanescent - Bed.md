I conceive; I deceive
I destroy; I employ
facets of my fancy
soon become my ante

Dictates, beliefs: agents of change
ever arranging, that fleeting exchange
shaping what fades, with every breath
I rail, I wail, as vultures prevail

Desperate, I search for my self
yearning to quantize, what's inside
logging my faults, stride after stride
certain that all will settle in time

so I pace through the quarry,
curious to find my quarry
beneath all that gray rock,
I will uncover who they mock.

shoveling away, I catch a familiar sheen
I wince as I realize: two gray stones, fit for a queen
and as I dust off, her glacial gaze devours mine
hateful, disdainful; a spirit cold as rime

How could she dare stake her claim?
how could she dare refuse our change?
how is it she always remains,
no matter what form I gain?

I dug this quarry, I wrought these stones;
and under them, I am resolved she must lie
Then, at long last, I will atone—
Oh lord, why wont she die!

So, I cloak my past in gloom and shadow
ill-lit by tragedy and awkward normality
yesterday now lost, and with it, the me of yester—
I dare look, and yet still, I only see her fester

A misshapen husk, desperate for form
dysmorphic, dysphoric; she's nothing more!
wearing dead norms as secondhand wear
she lives vicariously, stalking my shadow there.

we conceive; we deceive
we destroy; we employ
facets of our fancy
soon become our ante

We wonder who we were,
We wonder what we've been,
We wonder what we wanted
Or was it that we were wanted?

Others feel constant, we, variable;
as we oscillate through identity;
we reach for the next parable
yearning for new certainty.

Without compass, nor astrolabe
blind in a cave, seeking approval
to light our way, groping clumsily
as we stumble through the past

a quarter-century experiment,
executed with impairment.
a foolhardy case study,
a girl desperate to be left ruddy.

Left adrift, without scaffold
the self, constantly baffled
so alone, we consign ourselves
to dark, forgotten shelves.

A story best left unread,
a tome, sadly, preserved
within a grimoire most grave,
our fears we engrave.

Every helping hand a new fear,
every leech a welcome treat,
ready for slaughter, willing meat
We can't help but feel queer.

Where did we go, why did we forget;
why must we relive our mistakes
damned to cycle, from low to high
On the whims of a mayfly

like a deer in headlights;
we sink into ourselves
and see endless reflection,
forms of variegated inflection

forms past, yet foreign
a decrepit warren
of the "us" we have feared
and of "us" we have forgotten
  
we can't help but separate,
can't help but dissociate;
can't help but isolate;
can't help but flagellate

We pierce the hooks into our flesh,
become a butchers marionette;
so we dance as we were made
until at last, out we are laid.

Did we want to be forgot?
Are our affections easy bought?
Ourselves we have blot,
and so ever we will rot

a flower without soil
a work without toil,
a flame without oil,
a creature from which we recoil

it conceives; it deceives
it destroys; it employs
a shadow of its fancy
a victim of sycophancy,

**no more**.
