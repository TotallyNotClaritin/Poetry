I conceive; I deceive
I destroy; I employ
facets of my fancy
soon become my ante

Eternal, unrelenting: agents of change
ready to arrange, that most fleeting
with my every breath, a silent inner-death
I rail and wail, as vultures prevail

From where, do I arise
how can I quantize, of what I comprise
how can I surmise, what constantly dies
as I needlessly lie

I turn to gloom and shadow 
lit by odd tragedy and awkward normality
yesterday is lost, and with it, the me of yester
I look and I only see feel her fester

A misshapen husk, desperate for form
dysmorphic, dysphoric
wearing dead norms like
hand-me-down shapewear

we conceive; we deceive
we destroy; we employ
facets of our fancy
soon become our ante

We wonder who we were,
We wonder what we've been,
We wonder what we wanted
Or was it what we wanted?

Did we want to be forgot?
Are we easily bought?
This is who we've





it conceives; it deceives
it destroys; it employs
a facet of its fancy
a victim of sicophancy
